TurboVersion automates semantic versioning for your JavaScript/TypeScript projects, whether you're working with:

- � **Single-package repositories**
- 📦 **Monorepos with multiple packages**
- 🚀 **Modern JavaScript workspaces**

## Why Choose TurboVersion?

| Feature        | TurboVersion | Standard Tools |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Monorepo support | ✅ Automatic dependency tracking | ❌ Manual configuration |
| Version strategies | ✅ Commit messages & branch patterns | ❌ Usually just commits |
| Changelogs     | ✅ Automatic generation | ❌ Often separate tool |
| Configuration  | ✅ Single config file | ❌ Multiple rc files |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @turbo-version/version

# Bump versions based on changes
@turbo-version/version
```

## Key Features

### 🚦 Intelligent Version Bumping
- Automatically determines version bumps based on:
  - Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`)
  - Branch name patterns (`feature/`, `fix/`, `release/`)
- Supports all semver bump types: major, minor, patch, prereleases

### 📜 Effortless Changelogs
- Generates beautiful, organized changelogs from commits
- Groups changes by type (Features, Fixes, Breaking Changes)
- Links to commit history and GitHub comparisons

### 🧩 Monorepo Optimized
- Tracks dependencies between packages
- Only versions changed packages (async mode)
- Or keeps all packages in sync (synced mode)
- Updates cross-package references automatically

### ⚙️ Flexible Configuration
```json
// version.config.json
{
  "tagPrefix": "v",
  "preset": "angular",
  "synced": false,
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch"
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Analyzes Changes**
   Reads git history to detect affected packages

2. **Determines Version Bump**
   Uses commit messages or branch patterns

3. **Updates Versions**
   Modifies package.json files appropriately

4. **Generates Artifacts**
   Creates changelog, commits, and tags

5. **Ready for Publishing**
   Outputs clean package state for your CI/CD pipeline
